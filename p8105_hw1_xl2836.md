### Create data frame

First, we create a data frame comprised of:

-   A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution

-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2

-   A (length-10) character vector

-   A (length-10) factor vector

-A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution -A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2 -A (length-10) character vector -A (length-10) factor vector
